# Discount Order Calculator

There is my amazing microservice to calculate the discount from the orders.

## Getting Started

Here you can manage your JSON format orders.

First, you need to upload a JSON file with the valid format. There are few examples in the follow directory:

``` 
'Data/orders-example/'
```

Then... If the page returns 'Order loaded!', you can add or remove the items loaded, using the respective buttons.

### Getting the results

To check your order total and see if you can get a discount, just click on "Check Total" and the magic happens... or not! :) 
But I want to believe that yes!
